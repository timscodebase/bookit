## The least spooky way to build your components

Pronounced Boo-Kit or Book-It

A new Story environment with a different approach. Finely tuned to work directly within your Svelte Kit projects. Stay tuned for more information and docs on how to use and add to your projects.

### Why it's dope

- Easy
- Build for Svelte Kit
- No webpack, or extra build process
- Integrated into your app
- Themeable
- Use your real data
- Simple

### How to install

1. Download or clone the Bookit repo
2. Copy the `book` folder into the 'routes' folder of your Svelte Kit project

### How to use

Anywhere in your app, you create a '*.story.svelte' to show a component. You can also create a 'stories' folder to organize your stories.

### '*.story.svelte' structure

- title: The title of the component
- parent: The category of the component
